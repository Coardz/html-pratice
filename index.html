    <h1>Which <strong>Roblox</strong> game had the most visits in 2022?</h1>
    <p><strong>Roblox</strong> is one of the most popular video games worldwide. It boasts over 50,000,000 users daily, and the previous year significantly impacted <strong>Roblox</strong>’s growth. In this piece, we answer one of many questions that players have about the platform: which <strong>Roblox</strong> game had the most visits in 2022? Even though this data is not officially tracked, the most visited <strong>Roblox</strong> game is extremely requested information.</p>

    <h2> WHAT IS THE MOST VISITED <strong>ROBLOX</strong> GAME IN 2022? </h2>
    
    <p>According to official information, Adopt Me is the most visited <strong>Roblox</strong> game of all time. At the moment of writing, the game has 31.9 billion visits. Moreover, the game significantly increases in popularity year by year. It is nearly impossible to find a <strong>Roblox</strong> fan who has not played it.

        Therefore, most players consider Adopt Me the most visited <strong>Roblox</strong> game in 2022, but it's not true according to the statistics. The most visited <strong>Roblox</strong> game of 2022 is <em>Brookhaven</em>, which took second place in the list of all-time most popular games. At the end of 2021, the game was visited 12.2 billion times. Nowadays, <em>Brookhaven</em> has an insane 26.4 billion visits, meaning that the game was visited more than 10 billion times in 2022.
        
        Surprisingly, <em>Brookhaven</em> and Adopt Me have no competitors among other <strong>Roblox</strong> games. They are regularly updated, and they continue to increase in popularity even in 2023. It seems that their top spots for the most visited <strong>Roblox</strong> game will last for many years.</p>
    
    <h2> WHAT IS <strong>ROBLOX</strong> <em>BROOKHAVEN</em>? </h2>
    
    <p>Most <strong>Roblox</strong> fans know about <em>Brookhaven</em>, but some players still have no clue about this game. <strong>Roblox</strong> <em>Brookhaven</em> is a unique RPG created by Wolfpaq and Aidanleewolf. It was created in April 2020 and has gotten over 20 billion visits since.

        <em>Brookhaven</em> is a large city where you can become rich and buy giant houses and luxury cars. Plenty of vehicles and buildings in this game are pretty accessible, which is one of the main reasons for <em>Brookhaven</em>’s popularity. However, such simplicity is not always a good thing. Continue reading the guide, and you will find out three main reasons why players criticise <em>Brookhaven</em>.</p>
    
    <h2> WHY DO PLAYERS CRITICISE <em>BROOKHAVEN</em>? </h2>
    
    <p>The main reason why many <strong>Roblox</strong> players refuse to play <em>Brookhaven</em> is that the game has transformed into a dating platform for children as opposed to its initial role-playing mechanics.

        The second reason <strong>Roblox</strong> players criticise <em>Brookhaven</em> is that it has developed a toxic community. And the last reason is that the game has now become significantly monetised. Battle Passes impact your gameplay and can even increase your car speed, and if you refuse to contribute real money to the game, you might just be constantly called a noob.
        
        There you have it with the most visited <strong>Roblox</strong> game in 2022. Even though the most popular <strong>Roblox</strong> game is Adopt Me, <em>Brookhaven</em> took a lead during the previous year.
